## What is Multer, fs, and path?

- **Multer**: A middleware for handling file uploads in Node.js. It processes `multipart/form-data` and saves files (like images) to your server.

- **fs**: The Node.js File System module. It allows you to read, write, delete, and manage files and directories on the server.

- **path**: A Node.js module used to handle and format file paths safely across different operating systems.
